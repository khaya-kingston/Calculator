# Calculator
Calculator Project

This project is going to produce an interactive calculator that a user can work with. It will have the basic +,-,*,/ operations 
as well as brackets, decimal points, clear, =, !, and exponent buttons. Other buttons may be added eventually but this is the main structure.

The calculator should have a screen, which logs both calculations and results.
